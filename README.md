# Eagles-Journal-Submission

Abstract: The bald eagle, an American Icon, was recognized as an endangered species in 1967 after its population dropped to critically low numbers due to the adverse reproductive effects of DDT.  After DDT was banned in 1972, another environmental contaminant continued to affect their recovery, lead. Ingestion of lead-based ammunition was shown to be the eagles' top cause of death, resulting in a 1991 ban of its use for waterfowl hunting.  Nearly thirty years later, lead-toxicity in bald eagles persists.  The main source of lead is now carrion contaminated with lead from hunters' ammunition. Lead-toxicity may have severe clinical consequences (including death), but also more subtle, chronic ones such as reduced fertility and voracity. We formulate an ODE model to describe the progression through different stages of lead-toxicity and its impact on the dynamics of the eagle population.  We compare and contrast the impact of percentage of contaminated carrion vs.\ treatment of lead-toxicity.  Our results suggest that the health of bald eagle population in the Great Lakes region is more sensitive to the percentage of available contaminated carrion than to the treatment of lead-toxicity.
